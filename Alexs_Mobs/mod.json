    "description": "lex's Mobs is a Forge mod that adds 34 new mobs to Minecraft. All of these mobs fall into either two categories: most of them are real world creatures, like Grizzly Bears, Roadrunners, Orcas, etc; but some of them are purely fictional, like the Endergade and Bone Serpent, yet do not feel out of place in Minecraft.",
